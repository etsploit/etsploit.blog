Then shoot Witherhoard into cave entrance when enemies spawn. Collect 50x engrams and deposit.\nPhryzhia, the Insatiable (Ogre Encounter) # Subclass: Middle Tree Dawnblade (Well of Radiance)\nKinetic: Fatebringer\nEnergy: Null Composure\nPower: Sleeper Simulant\nStrategy: Kill Fallen Vandel and collect scorch cannon. Enter the right-side room and collect 12-15 engrams. Do not be afraid to use your super since you will instantly get it back when you collect 10x engrams. Deposit engrams at crystal and repeat for left-side room. Once you deposit 25 engrams total you can damage the boss. Place your Well of Radiance, apply Particle Deconstruction with Null Composure, then focus on hitting headshots with Sleeper Simulant. Repeat 2-3 times until the Ogre is dead.\nSparrow Encounter # Subclass: n/a\nKinetic: n/a\nEnergy: n/a\nPower: Any Sword\nStrategy: Take your time and hit every button to extend the mine timer. If you do this you will have plently of time to get disarm all 4 mines.\nCannon Encounter # Subclass: Bottom Tree Nova Bomb\nKinetic: Witherhoard\nEnergy: Ikelos SMG\nPower: Half-Truths w/ Eager Edge\nStrategy: Look for where the shielded seritor is located, proc Devour and kill enemies until you can deposit 20 engrams at the crystal at each cannon location. Kill Servitor once the shield drops and then use the scorch cannon to fire the dead servitor at the hot air baloon in the middle of the arena. Repeat 3 more times, then use the man cannon in the middle of the arena to shoot yourself up to the top to move on\nCaptain Avarokk, the Covetous (Final Boss) # Subclass: Middle Tree Dawnblade (Well of Radiance)\nKinetic: Fatebringer\nEnergy: Null Composure\nPower: Sleeper Simulant\nStrategy: Start encounter and move to either side of the room where you have some cover. Kill the red-bar enemies on that side until it is clear. Use your sleeper to kill the Shank named R-M80. Then focus on killing the yellow-bar Vandal named Grisprax. You can use any weapon to kill him but I found Sleeper works best. Once he is dead, deposit the 10 engrams he drops at the crystal in the center of the arena. Kill the Scorch Vandal and grab the Scorch Cannon he drops. Use the charge shot from it and shoot it at one one of the 3 terminals in the arena. There is one on the left, right, and middle of the arena. Collect 10-20 engrams as they fall from the walls and deposit them at the crystal in the middle. Repeat until you have deposited a total of 50 engrams. Once you have deposited 50 engrams the damage phase will start. Same as the Ogre encounter, place your Well of Radiance, apply the Particle Deconstruction debuff with Null Composure, and then focus on hitting critical shots with Sleeper Simulant. Repeat that process until the boss is dead. Optimally it should only take 3 damage phases.\n","date":"13 December 2021","permalink":"/posts/goa-flawless/","section":"Posts","summary":"All encounters done on Warlock  Loot Cave Entrance # Subclass: Bottom Tree Nova Bomb","title":"Grasp of Avarice (Solo Flawless)"}]
