[{"content":"Objective: Create a vulnerability management lab from an Ubuntu box #    I included more screenshots in my notes here\nGithub Project Link: https://github.com/users/etsploit/projects/8\nReference Video:\n Note: Josh is doing this tutorial from a Windows Host, I\u0026rsquo;m actually giving instructions from an Ubuntu box which will be slightly different\nPrep Steps, Install Virtualization, Nessus, Windows #  Download VMware Player https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html Download Windows 10 ISO https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO Download Nessus Essentials https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials   The tutorial ran this from a Windows Host Machine, I\u0026rsquo;m running Ubuntu locally so opted for the Ubuntu 20.04 Nessus debian package  Got to make the .bundle file executable (the VMWare File) Install VMware Player (run bundle script like this: ./my_shell_script)  chmod +x VMware-Player-Full-16.2.3-19376536.x86_64.bundle sudo ./VMware-Player-Full-16.2.3-19376536.x86_64.bundle Get Nessus running on Ubuntu  cd Downloads sudo apt install ./Nessus*_amd64.deb sudo systemctl enable --now nessusd sudo systemctl status nessusd sudo ufw allow 8834 Go to https://localhost:8834/#/   Might want to remember to close that port later  Set Up Dummy Windows VM # Install Windows 10 as a VM on your host machine   this will be the machine we will be scanning with Nessus  Run ipconfig within the Dummy Windows VM to find your IP Ping that IP from your host Ubuntu machine (it will fail) Gotta lower the firewall in Windows so you can get connected Ping again, it should go thru  Scan IP with Nessus # Use the Dummy Windows IP as your target for a basic Nessus Scan Configure the VM for credentialed scans (these next steps) Enable Remote Registry from Windows Services Open Registry Editor and Add a DWORD Create LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, Set Value to 1 Restart your Windows Dummy VM Scan Again  Installing Deprecated Software on Dummy Windows VM # Why? By installing old junk you will quickly be able to the basic process for spotting vulnerabilities and remediating them. As such, often vulnerabilities a simply because of old software\u0026hellip;in this case Firefox.\nInstall old Firefox version from https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/3.6.12/win32/en-US/ on your Dummy Windows VM Scan Again\u0026hellip;see the fuckery Remove Firefox, update Windows, and now you\u0026rsquo;ve remediated shit  What\u0026rsquo;s The Point of All of This? The value in this exercise is getting some hands-on working knowledge of the Nessus scanning tool especially if you\u0026rsquo;ve never used it before. Working as an assessor as well as vulnerability scanning engineer it can be helpful to understand how Nessus works and outputs even if I\u0026rsquo;m not running scans everyday. Also there is entire career field and skill in vulnerability management for those interested.
